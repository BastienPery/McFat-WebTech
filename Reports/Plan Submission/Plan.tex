        Usually, when (young) people go to some foreign country, and they are not sure where and what to eat, the most simple choice is to choose McDonalds restaurant. Therefore, we decided to create the app that will help us finding the nearest McDonalds restaurant, but will also give us and few other important information. For example, we might be interested whether the McDonalds we want to visit has drive in option, or maybe we just want to find out the exact calorie content of meals we want to eat. Also, additional information that we might find useful would be comparing prices from different countries, so we know how much more or less money are we paying than we would pay in our home country. If we feel that we have the time, we will add more functionality along the way.\\ \\ \\
           The main purpose of the web application is to conveniently display statistics about McDonalds. Such as finding the nearest restaurant, listing calorie content of meals and comparing prices from different countries. If we feel that we have the time, we will add more functionality along the way.
